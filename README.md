# WesterosBlocks

WesterosBlocks is a custom mod for Minecraft Forge that adds thousands of custom blocks for use with the [WesterosCraft](https://westeroscraft.com) server.

This mod requires the [ConnectedTexturesMod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ctm) as well as the [WesterosCTM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/westerosctm) extension in order for certain textures to appear correctly.
