# Preamble

The WesterosBlocks texture pack originated from [Dokucraft](https://dokucraft.co.uk/), but contains elements from other resource packs including [John Smith](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/) and [Conquest](https://conquestreforged.com/) (and overlays by [Ardacraft](https://ardacraft.me/)). We have made many alterations and additions to the pack over the years, so most of the textures are originals only to be found in this pack. Ultimately, we aim for the WesterosBlocks textures to be made up exclusively from original textures created by artists within the community.

The sound components were created and/or arranged by Hal9007. The sound effects used in this resource pack are based off of edited loops and sound samples from [SoundJay.com](https://www.soundjay.com/) or [Pond5.com](https://www.pond5.com/). Third-party samples are either public domain or paid for under an Attribution 3.0 licesnse.

If you want to use any of these originals feel free to do so, but it would be cool of you to credit all the contributors. If you want to use any of the textures by the below mentioned artists, please consult the individual homepages and seek their permission.

**Do not sell this resource pack! Ever.**

Cheers,
