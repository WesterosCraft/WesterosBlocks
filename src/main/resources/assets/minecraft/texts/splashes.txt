What is dead may never die...

Seven hells!

Winter is coming...

A Lannister always pays his debts.

Family, Duty, Honor

A naked man has few secrets, a flayed man has none.

It is usually what we don't know that kills us.

Stick 'em with the pointy end.

Fear cuts deeper than swords.

The night is dark and full of creepers.

Nothing burns like the cold.

Dumbledore dies.

The things I do for love...

If I look back I am lost.

Words are wind.

A bear there was, a bear, a bear!

All dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards are dwarfs.

Make the bad man fly!

In this world, only winter is certain.

Shagga will chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats!

Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken

We Do Not Sow

Hear Me Roar

High as Honor

Fire and Blood

HODOR!!!

You win or you die.

Valar Morgulis.

Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

Hodor?

Hodor, hodor, hodor!!
